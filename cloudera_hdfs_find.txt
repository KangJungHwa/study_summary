org.apache.solr.hadoop.HdfsFindTool -help

Usage: hadoop fs [generic options]
[-find <path> ... <expression> ...]
[-help [cmd ...]]
[-usage [cmd ...]]
-find <path> ... <expression> ...:
Finds all files that match the specified expression and applies selected actions to them.

The following primary expressions are recognised:
  -atime n
  -amin n
    Evaluates as true if the file access time subtracted from
    the start time is n days (or minutes if -amin is used).
  -blocks n
    Evaluates to true if the number of file blocks is n.
  -class classname [args ...]
    Executes the named expression class.
  -depth
    Always evaluates to true. Causes directory contents to be
    evaluated before the directory itself.
  -empty
    Evaluates as true if the file is empty or directory has no
    contents.
  -group groupname
    Evaluates as true if the file belongs to the specified
    group.
  -mtime n
  -mmin n
    Evaluates as true if the file modification time subtracted
    from the start time is n days (or minutes if -mmin is used)
  -name pattern
  -iname pattern
    Evaluates as true if the basename of the file matches the
    pattern using standard file system globbing.
    If -iname is used then the match is case insensitive.
  -newer file
    Evaluates as true if the modification time of the current
    file is more recent than the modification time of the
    specified file.
  -nogroup
    Evaluates as true if the file does not have a valid group.
  -nouser
    Evaluates as true if the file does not have a valid owner.
  -perm [-]mode
  -perm [-]onum
    Evaluates as true if the file permissions match that
    specified. If the hyphen is specified then the expression
    shall evaluate as true if at least the bits specified
    match, otherwise an exact match is required.
    The mode may be specified using either symbolic notation,
    eg 'u=rwx,g+x+w' or as an octal number.
  -print
  -print0
    Always evaluates to true. Causes the current pathname to be
    written to standard output. If the -print0 expression is
    used then an ASCII NULL character is appended.
  -prune
    Always evaluates to true. Causes the find command to not
    descend any further down this directory tree. Does not
    have any affect if the -depth expression is specified.
  -replicas n
    Evaluates to true if the number of file replicas is n.
  -size n[c]
    Evaluates to true if the file size in 512 byte blocks is n.
    If n is followed by the character 'c' then the size is in bytes.
  -type filetype
    Evaluates to true if the file type matches that specified.
    The following file type values are supported:
    'd' (directory), 'l' (symbolic link), 'f' (regular file).
  -user username
    Evaluates as true if the owner of the file matches the
    specified user.
The following operators are recognised:
  expression -a expression
  expression -and expression
  expression expression
    Logical AND operator for joining two expressions. Returns
    true if both child expressions return true. Implied by the
    juxtaposition of two expressions and so does not need to be
    explicitly specified. The second expression will not be
    applied if the first fails.
  ! expression
  -not expression
    Evaluates as true if the expression evaluates as false and
    vice-versa.
  expression -o expression
  expression -or expression
    Logical OR operator for joining two expressions. Returns
    true if one of the child expressions returns true. The
    second expression will not be applied if the first returns
    true.
-help [cmd ...]:
Displays help for given command or all commands if none
is specified.
-usage [cmd ...]:
Displays the usage for given command or all commands if none
is specified.
Generic options supported are
-conf <configuration file>     specify an application configuration file
-D <property=value>            use value for given property
-fs <local|namenode:port>      specify a namenode
-jt <local|jobtracker:port>    specify a job tracker
-files <comma separated list of files>    specify comma separated files to be copied to the map reduce cluster
-libjars <comma separated list of jars>    specify comma separated jar files to include in the classpath.
-archives <comma separated list of archives>    specify comma separated archives to be unarchived on the compute machines.

The general command line syntax is
bin/hadoop command [genericOptions] [commandOptions]


For example, to find all files that:

Are contained in the directory tree hdfs:///user/$USER/solrloadtest/twitter/tweets
Have a name matching the glob pattern sample-statuses*.gz
Were modified less than 60 minutes ago
Are between 1 MB and 1 GB
You could use the following:

$ hadoop jar /usr/lib/solr/contrib/mr/search-mr-*-job.jar \
org.apache.solr.hadoop.HdfsFindTool -find \
hdfs:///user/$USER/solrloadtest/twitter/tweets -type f -name \
'sample-statuses*.gz' -mmin -60 -size -1000000000c -size +1000000c
